# Morphometrics-and-its-applications
## A repo to introduce MORPHOMETRICS

We want to make MORPHOMETRICS more easier for the community.

Here, we introduce a GUI application based on MATLAB to fit and classify the biological curve samples. The main algorithm was introduced in the following paper initially:

Zhou, S., Li, B., & Nie, H. (2021). Parametric fitting and morphometric analysis of 3d open curves based on discrete cosine transform. *Zoomorphology*, 2, 301â€“314. doi:10.1007/s00435-021-00520-w. (JCR Q2 IF = 1.138 ).
